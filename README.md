## Introduction
This university project explores the demand for bike-sharing systems, focusing on how different factors such as weather, time, and user type influence rental patterns. The analysis aims to provide insights that could help improve the efficiency and marketing strategies of bike-sharing services.

## Motivation
The study is driven by the need to understand user behaviors and seasonal impacts on bike-sharing usage, which is crucial for the operational success and sustainability of these urban mobility systems.

## Data Source
The project utilizes a dataset containing hourly rental data along with weather and seasonal information. Attributes include time stamps, weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and user classifications (casual or registered).

## Analysis Overview
The project involves:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns in bike rentals.
- Building and comparing several predictive models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to forecast demand.

## Results
Our findings highlight significant variances in bike rental behaviors among different user types and under various weather conditions. The Random Forest model provided the most accurate predictions for rental demand.
